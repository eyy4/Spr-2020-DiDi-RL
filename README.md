### Abstract

We propose a novel method to tackle the problem of driver repositioning on ride-hailing platforms through off-policy evaluation by the creation of an environment simulator. First, we propose to create an environment simulator using historical data that stochastically generates uncensored demand, supply,passenger/driver matching and destination probability. Next,the environment simulator may be leveraged for off-policy evaluation through Monte Carlo rollout. Finally, we propose that a generalized policy iteration process may be applied for off-policy learning.
